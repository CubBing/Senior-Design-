AI Fitness Coach

Welcome to our senior design project.
We are currently in the process of developing an AI fitness coach.

As of right now these are the functionalities of our AI fitness coach: 
User selects which workout to choose, squat, curl, or pushups -------- pushups has not fully been implemented yet
Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, we are able to use a camera to detect and skeletonize the human body
With the skeleton, we are able to calculate the angles of specifc landmarks and with the angle we also use this to count the repetiton of select workout.
